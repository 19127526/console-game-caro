4.1 Save/load – 2m
In this guideline, we cannot save and load the game. We need two features. When the
players hit ‘L’, we show the line requesting the players provide the filename to save.
When the players hit ‘T’, we show the line requesting the players provide the file to load.


4.2 Recognize win/lose/draw – 2m
Need to provide the caro rule to know win/lose/draw.

4.3 Provide animation of win/lose/draw – 2m
In this guideline, we only print the simple line showing win/lose/draw. Provide the vivid
animation for this event.

4.4 Creating playing interface – 1.5m
When two players tick the board, we print some statistics of two players, for example,
counting the number of ticking for each player … You yourself organize the interface
such that it is clear and pretty.

4.5 Provide the main menu – 1.5m
When coming to boardgame, we print the menu game, for example, “New Game”, “Load
Game”, “Settings”, … So, this helps the players to easily choose actions they want.

4.6 Playing with machine (Alpha – beta pruning) – 1m
Allow the players to choose “play with machine”, and the players can choose the level,
for example, easy-level if we allow machine to randomize the position, and hard-level if
we apply the alpha – beta pruning.
